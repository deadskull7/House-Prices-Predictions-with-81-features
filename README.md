# House-Prices-Predictions-with-81-features

#### The dataset consists of 81 features of each house(lot prop. , garage prop. , basement prop. , year built, .....) which almost contains each and every minute detail of each house along with their respective sale prices .
#### The whole kernel goes along with the missing value imputations in a very detailed and explorative manner .
#### Since we have many features (both categorical and numerical) , the inter-relationship of each feature with any other is quite difficult and cumbersome to analyse .
#### One of the feature's missing value imputation ( apart from Sale Price ) is done by modelling and prediction as a demo and rest using the cross-tabulations , mean , mode and median .
#### Finally normalizing the matrix and predicting the values along with cross validation root-mean-square error .
